# Project Diva Arcade Modpack R1

## Introduction

Hello everyone, I am Raki and this is my gift for you peasants. This modpack is my first mod release out of the Project Diva series.

**What's contained in this modpack?**

Well, first thing is a freaking UI theme out of the Arcade Future Tone. All thanks to **Kuji Kita** (_Kuji Kita#8810_) who has come across all odds to leaked almost every information and data that I needed to make this happened.

And second thing, a shitload of 29 songs ported from **Project Diva Future Tone DX** (PS4). I’m not lucky enough to be one of those AFT hoarders so it took me a lot of hard work to port those craps. I heard that for AFT data, it’s just a fucking easy copy and paste. Whatever lol. You guys should keep in mind that those hoarders will never share the whole thing to you guys.

**Is this a virus? Is this reliable?**

It’s not a virus since there are only data in this pack. Just only `*.txt`, `*.bin`, `*farc`, scripts and songs. The audio is copied directly from FTDX, originally 4 channels with no re-encode or multiply to 8 channels. And for the reliability? It’s just a beta release so I can’t tell. For bug reporting, just go to my Github. Keep reading, the links are below there.

## Arcade Future Tone Theme

Please note that this is not a complete theme yet (since there are lack of files and some UI and functions is not unlocked by the Teknoparrot and ELAC loaders yet).

Here is some comparision between this mod and the original AFT. Photos courtesy of **Kuji Kita** (_Kuji Kita#8810_). Thank you for your collaboration my friend.

Thanks to everyone who encouraging me doing this shitty job. Thanks to **Cainan** who triggered the fck out of me for doing that and also helping me for testing my crappy `DivaScriptConv` tool. Thanks to **Kuji Kita** for leaking some shit out of the Arcade Future Tone dump. Thanks to **Skyth** (blueskythlikesclouds) for making `MikuMikuModel` and thanks to **Samyuu** for digging every aspect of the `DivaScript` format.
